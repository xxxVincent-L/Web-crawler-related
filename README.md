# Web-crawler-related

This repo is related to the web crawler which will be used to the final project of computer network in school of computing, Sichuan University :)

>The final task is mainly about getting the specific class curriculum in Sichuan university.

Aimed to finish the final task, I have to read tons of articles related to web crawler.

Hope to get those fxxking things done soon! :)

# Phase Ⅰ: Login Page

* Success to login

    * **session.post(xx,xx,xx)**:n

            The first parameter is a URL about the login page's security check other than the original login page!

    * **Bugs**： 
    
        It costs me about an hour to figure out the problem of "**Unable to access '': OpenSSL SSL_read: Connection was reset**"
        
        After searching for blogs regarding this problem, It's still unsolvable. But after I cleaning up those branch thing, is 's finished! :) 
        
    > I don't know why there always be some problem about the pull and push...It seems like "**Unable to access '': OpenSSL SSL_read: Connection was reset**" is shown when you pull or push. The essence of it may be the synchronization of local and remote repository -> Merge problem of l and r.
    

# Phase Ⅱ: Raw data acquisition

> To be continued :)
