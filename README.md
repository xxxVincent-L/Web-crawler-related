# Web-crawler-related

This repo is related to the web crawler which will be used to the final project of computer network in school of computing, Sichuan University :)

## The final task is mainly about getting the specific class curriculum in Sichuan university.

Aimed to finish the final task, I have to read tons of articles related to web crawler.

Hope to get those fxxking things done soon! :)

# Phase I: Login Page

* Success to login

**session.post(xx,xx,xx)**:n

The first parameter is a URL about the login page's security check other than the original login page!

Btw, It costs me about an hour to figure out the problem of "**Unable to access '': OpenSSL SSL_read: Connection was reset**"

After searching for blogs regarding this problem, It's still unsolvable. But after I cleaning up those branch thing, is 's finished! :)
